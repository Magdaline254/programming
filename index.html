        <h1 class="tribute-title">Marie Curie</h1>
        <p class="tribute-text">
            She was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on
            radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win the
            Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.
        </p>
        <p class="tribute-text">
            I admire Marie Curie for her intelligence, her dedication, and her courage. She was a true pioneer who made
            significant contributions to our understanding of the universe and to the development of new medical
            treatments. She is an inspiration to us all.
